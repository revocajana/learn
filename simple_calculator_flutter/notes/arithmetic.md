# Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations are the foundation of mathematics and are essential for performing calculations in various applications, including our calculator app. The four basic arithmetic operations are:

## 1. Addition
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to obtain a total. The symbol for addition is `+`. For example:
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 10 + 15 = 25

## 2. Subtraction
Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. The symbol for subtraction is `-`. For example:
- 5 - 2 = 3
- 20 - 5 = 15

## 3. Multiplication
Multiplication is the process of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. The symbol for multiplication is `*` or `×`. For example:
- 4 * 3 = 12 (which is 4 added to itself 3 times: 4 + 4 + 4)
- 7 × 2 = 14

## 4. Division
Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. The symbol for division is `/`. For example:
- 10 / 2 = 5 (which means 10 is divided into 2 equal parts of 5)
- 15 ÷ 3 = 5

## Order of Operations
When performing calculations that involve multiple arithmetic operations, it is important to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:
- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents
- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

For example, in the expression:
- 3 + 5 * 2 = 3 + 10 = 13 (not 16, because multiplication comes before addition)

## Conclusion
Understanding these basic arithmetic operations is crucial for using the calculator effectively. Each operation serves a different purpose and can be combined to solve more complex mathematical problems.
